Tarbak is a very simple shell script designed to back up a few hosts to a central backup server.  If you have to back up more than 5 or 6 hosts, you probably don't want to use tarbak. 

I wrote this script to back up my VPS server to a backup server that I had no physical control over and had users with root access.  Tarbak will allow you to back up your data in such a way that nobody can read it, you don't need root access, and it doesn't have to be able to log into your host.

You will need a backup server with the following:

1.  Enough disk space for the backups, tarbak doesn't overwrite full backups.  If your space is limited, you will need a way to rotate them (a very simple shell script will suffice).

2.  Your ssh key in your authorized keys file. 

3.  You don't need root on the backup server.

To set up tarbak:

1.  Set up your gpg encryption keys.  You can read how to do this on the gnupg web site: http://www.gnupg.org/

2.  Generate an ssh key pair.  Put the ssh public key into your authorized keys file on the backup server

3.  Use your editor and edit the tarbak script.  You must set the following variables to suit your system:

#Passed to tar as command line arguments. 
EXCLUDE='--exclude="cdrom*/*" --exclude="dev/*" --exclude="media/*" --exclude="mnt/*" --exclude="proc/*" --exclude="sys/*" --exclude="usr/ports/*" --exclude="usr/src/*" --exclude="var/tmp/*"'

#location of tar binary
TAR=/usr/bin/tar

#location of date binary
DATE=/bin/date

#location of gpg binary
GPG=/usr/local/bin/gpg

#gpg public key you want to use for encryption
GPGKEY=ACE0D7E9

#gpg cipher
CIPHER=AES256

#gpg digest algorithm
DIGEST=SHA512

#gpg compression algorithm
COMPRESS=BZIP2

#other options to pass to gpg
GPGOPTS="--no-secmem-warning"

#location of ssh binary
SSH=/usr/bin/ssh

#ssh key to use
SSHKEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa

#On what host do you want to store your backup
SSHHOST=backuphost.example.com

#What username are you going to use on the remote system
SSHUSER=mysshuser

#what directory should have your backups
BACKUPDIR=/backup/dest/dir

#this file is touched every time you run a full backup.  It is used to date the backup
FULLBACKUPFILE=/tmp/lastfullbackup

#this file is touched whenever a full or incremental backup is run. 
INCBACKUPFILE=/tmp/incbackupfile

4.  Add Tarbak to cron like this:

#full backup
0 1 * * Sun /usr/local/sbin/tarbak full

#differential backup - back up everything since the last full backup
0 1 * * Mon-Sat /usr/local/sbin/tarbak diff

#incremental backup - back up everything since the last incremental backup
0 1 * * Mon-Sat /usr/local/sbin/tarbak inc
